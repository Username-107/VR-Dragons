# VR-Dragons
IMPORTANT: THE LANGUAGE CALCULATOR SAYS THIS PROJECT IS IN C++, BUT IT IS IN C#, THE C++ IS UNITY-GENERERATED FILES, THE ACTUAL CODE IS ALL C#.

Hello and welcome to my project! This is created for Oculus Quest.
Codecks: https://flh.codecks.io
In addition, you must download https://drive.google.com/file/d/17n8dqkvaV4_dPD2h2dXI2NhVtbyIiHx5/view?usp=sharing and put it in the main project folder to play. Enjoy!
This project is still very much in beta. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!
